Welcome!

In this assignment, we will learn how to do parallel programing using python! 

Below, you will find a section that broadly covers things we did in the class, that may or may not relevant with the assignment. However, This [introductory knowledge section](#introductory-knowledge-on-concepts) can be very much benefical for you while doing this assignment! Hence, **reading** it is a few times is crucial for you!

The goal of this assignment is to teach you the difference between serial and parallel programming, and to get your familar with concepts such as *threading*, *multiprocessing*, etc. Enjoy!
