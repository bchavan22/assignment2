# Assignment 2 - Parallel Programming with Python

![header-image](assets/carbon.png)

Welcome!

In this assignment, we will learn how to do parallel programing using python! 

Below, you will find a section that broadly covers things we did in the class, that may or may not relevant with the assignment. However, This [introductory knowledge section](#introductory-knowledge-on-concepts) can be very much benefical for you while doing this assignment! Hence, **reading** it is a few times is crucial for you!

The goal of this assignment is to teach you the difference between serial and parallel programming, and to get your familar with concepts such as *threading*, *multiprocessing*, etc. Enjoy!

## Introductory Knowledge on Concepts

TBD

### Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency is running two tasks together. When a computer is able to run two tasks at the same time, or it looks as if it started together, we think tasks are running concurrent. While achieving concurrency, a computer may take advantage of[CPU time sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) feature of the operating system, where tasks wait each other and when one runs on the CPU and other on the queue.

Parallelism is can be done on a task or a group of task together. It takes advantage of physical CPU cores of the infrastructure that the computer has, and assigns part of the task or seperate tasks to different CPUs.

In [oracle docs](), concurrency is `a condition that exists when at least two threads are making progress. A more generalized form of parallelism that can include time-slicing as a form of virtual parallelism`. And, paralellism is 	
`a condition that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously`.

### Threading and Multiprocessing

TBD

### Packages in Python for Parallel Programming

There are many options to do parallel programming using python. You are more than welcome to choose any of those libraries including the standard packages. My advise is to test diffrent ones, so that you will cover more.

Some of these packages are, but not limited to:

- [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
- [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)
- [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin)
- [Dask](https://dask.org/)
- [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html)
- [threading](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/threading.html)
- [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/concurrent.futures.html)

### Creating a Developer Account

## Tasks

In this assignment, you are required to use parallel programming to do the two tasks already done in serial programming.

1. Download images from internet
2. Resize the images you download to thumbnails.

As you will see, when you run the notebook, these tasks are already done using serial programming logic. However, you will see that, the execution of these tasks takes quite a lot of time. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, to reduce these timings! 

Following are your list of tasks.

### Setup

- [ ] I created a developer account at [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).
- [ ] I run the notebook, after running the `Setup the Project` section, it created my `config.ini` file.
- [ ] My images are downloaded to `data/images` folder after running the notebook.
- [ ] I added the `access_key` I got from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) website to my `config.ini` file.

### Exploratory Data Analysis Tasks:

- [ ] Print a sample from the dataset.
- [ ] Create a histogram with at least 20 bins from `downloads` field. 
- [ ] Describe the `likes` field. Do an outlier analysis on using [5 number summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary).
- [ ] Find the average size of image ratio of the whole dataset using `width` and `height`.
- [ ] Find the unique number of `colors` of the dataset.
- [ ] Replace all the `None` fields in the `description` field with `Not provided` text.
- [ ] Expand `url` field into multiple columns.

### Downloading Images Tasks:

- [ ] I have at least 1500 images with the min qualiy of `regular`.
- [ ] Implemented downloading images with parallel programming logic.
- [ ] Reduce the amount taken in serial way with parallel programming.

### Resizing Images Tasks:

- [ ] Implemented resizing with parallel programming logic.
- [ ] Reduce the amount taken in serial way with parallel programming.

### Conclusion:

- [ ] I collect the timing results of all tasks, put them in a table.
- [ ] I show differences of serial and parallel way of doing the above operations.
- [ ] I understand the difference between `IO bound` and `CPU bound`.
- [Â ] I **wrote** a big conclusion that explains all the things that I've done, all supportive graphics, etc.

## What are All These Files?

Following table is will give it a meaning for each file.

File                | Description 
-------             | ----------- 
README.md           | A descriptive file to give an introduction of current project/ assignment. Includes a todo list that **you have to edit**.
LICENCE             | The licence of the file that every project should have.
.gitignore          | The file to control which files should be ignored by Git.
.gitkeep            | An empty file to keep folders under git.
requirements.txt    | A list of python packages you may need for the assignment.
Assignment2.ipynb   | Sample notebook as a reference for how your notebooks should be organized.
images.py           | Helper functions to do HW related tasks, all serial way.
utils.py            | Helper functions to create config file, progress bar, etc.
config.ini          | [Configuration file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) to connect Unsplash API.
data / images       | Folder to download images
data / json         | Folder to download data files from Unsplash API.

## Your To-Do List for This Assignment

- [ ] I **have completed** all the checkmarks in [tasks](#tasks) section.
- [ ] My notebook(s) are well organized with headings, comments, that makes it visually appealing.
- [ ] My notebook(s) have the results of my execution.
- [ ] My notebook(s) are reproducible.
- [ ] I download the final version of my repository, and uploaded to the blackboard!
